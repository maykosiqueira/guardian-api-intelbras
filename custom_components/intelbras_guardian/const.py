# Seconds between status polls against the middleware.
#
# 15 s, not 1 s: every poll opens a session against the cloud relay, and the
# panel serves one at a time — the same slot the phone app and the arm and
# disarm commands need. Measured on 2026-09-25: at 5 s a failing cycle takes
# 20 s or more (two connect attempts plus two status timeouts), so polls pile
# onto a panel that is already refusing connections, and a command arriving in
# the middle finds no slot free. Nothing here needs a faster cadence: alarm
# events arrive in real time over SSE, the automations confirm arm and disarm
# from the panel own event log, and the connection-unavailable debounce is
# measured in seconds, not in polls.
